                        Okay, there is much mastery to learn in what feels like a little time here. I put in for an awesome opportunity- this coding 'boot camp' located in Norcross. If it goes well, I'm going to be having the time of my techy little life over 12 weeks. However there's work to do...<br /><br />

                        <em>PHP/MySQL.</em><br /><br />

                        I knew nothing about it really, aside from it being a language of the databases. I remember about a month ago, I didn't really know where my time was going to be spent this summer or where to start with programming. I'm not a total novice. I can apply the logic of object-oriented programming from a few Computer Science classes I picked up at my university last year.<br /><br />

                        Despite my adoration for Java and UML diagrams, I'm no CS major. I opted for a degree in Information Science & Technology. As time progresses with the major, it's set up for you to learn all about database management, so I preserved my excitement for that day- BUT, life has a way of changing things around.<br /><br />

                        So far I've taken the Codecademy introduction to PHP course. To my surprise, it's a hell of a lot like Java. Actually, it's so much like Java, I breezed through it with minimal issues compared to Java which nearly made me cry. I knew PHP couldn't be that easy though. And it didn't take long to see they left out all the hard parts and virtually everything to do with an underscore (isn't that like all of it?). So upon completing the sugar-coated course, I received a 100%, however I felt like I still had learned zip about PHP. My thirst for knowledge continued.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Book Review: PHP and MySQL for Dummies</h2>
                        <img class="img-responsive"src="../img/posts/books/book1-img.jpg" alt=""/>
                        <p>This is a book. And so far, I have not read it. I did read the introduction however, and so far, it's good enough to keep reading.</p>

                        <p>Now I'm not at all saying, it's too good to put down. I'm just saying, the ratings may prove this book to be genuinely helpful.</p>
                        <blockquote><p>
                            Insert interesting quote here... Yep yep, blah blah blah.. Mhm..
                        </p></blockquote>

                        <p>AUTHOR LAST NAME pretty much wrote the entire Dummy series on PHP and MySQL. Honestly, I was expecting more to learn about his creditials. When I read books like this from the 'for Dummies' series, I like to know how much of a right the author has to assume I'm a dummy.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">What I've Learned</h2>

                        <p>As the time got further and further away, I realized this course was not getting any harder. Finally I had completed it just to see 100%. The course pathetically lacked depth to the point that I didn't even gather a false sense of security from it. The lesson it taught me was far from the one that it intended to: Skip ahead next time. Look the course over, and decide to yourself, "Is this really worth the next <em>x</em> amount of hours?" </p>

                        <p>In conclusion, I leave a brief note for the Codecademies out there.</p>

                        <p>I understand we're handing out awards to people who just participate nowadays, and the need for praise and self-worth is ever-present as well. But let's not waste people's time with this kind of redundant teaching. If this were an object-oriented programming refresher, then this would be great, however it's not. And that's the problem.</p>
