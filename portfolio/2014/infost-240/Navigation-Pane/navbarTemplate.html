    <td height="550" colspan="4" id="main"><a><img src="skydiving-photo.jpg" alt="photo: happy tandem landing" align="right" height="250" width="250"></a>&nbsp;     Jumping tandem is a great way to experience the thrilling excitement of freefall skydiving and the serenity of parachute flight! Whether you're after a once-in-a-lifetime experience, looking for an annual outing or you want to learn to skydive, a tandem is a great introduction to the sport.
<br>
<em>No ground school is required.</em> After a short video and a personalized briefing with your instructor, you'll board the plane together with a parachute and harness built for two.
<br>
After a 50 second freefall from 14,500 feet, you'll enjoy a scenic 3-5 minute parachute flight before landing.
<br>
Our USPA certified professional tandem instructors will show you a great time, and available video and photography packages let you relive the jump forever.
